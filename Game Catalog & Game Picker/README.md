# This project was my final assignment regarding both HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This assignment represents my skill in the used languages while learning the front-end
# I did end up learning a few things throughout this assignment. I am aware that the code here may be seen as messy spaghetti code. It should be noted that I had originally challenged myself throughout the development of the GamePicker project by assigning myself two rules:
# 1. Reduce the ammout of lines as much as possible.
# 2. Only use a simple HTML file with nothing more than a <body> and 2 <div> elements.
# Please assume that this code is not a direct reflection of my overall code quality and other major projects should be used to reflect that.

# Setup Guide:
# 1: Open the 'Game Catalog & Game Picker' directory through Visual Studio Code.
# 2: Go to VS Code extensions and search: "Live Server". From there download any other live server or download: "Live Server - Ritwick Dey". This extension is neccesary in order for the Game Picker to load .json data locally!
# 3: Run the any of the HTML files through the live server by either of the following methods:
# 1. Right-click the file and select 'Open with Live Server'.
# 2. Open the file and select 'Go Live' in the Status Bar at the bottom-right of the screen.
# 4: If succesful, a new tab should've opened in your default browser as a localhost session.
