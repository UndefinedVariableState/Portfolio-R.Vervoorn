# This project was my final assignment regarding both PHP and MySQL. This assignment represents my skill in the used languages while learning the back-end. All of the assets in the .idea and resources directories of this project had been provided as templating and were not made by me. Everything that had been provided beforehand can be found inside the template.zip file (characters.sql was provided seperately).

# Setup Guide (WINDOWS 10 ONLY!!!):

# 1. Download the charactercatalog.zip file and unzip it with a unzipper-tool of choice.
# 2. Download Ampps (Localhost server) and make sure you have the following versions enabled:
# - Apache Webserver: Version 2.4.53 or higher.
# - PHP: Version 7.4 or higher. (Recommended to use PHP 7.4 to prevent issues with depricated code)
# - MySQL: Version 8.0.29 or higher.
# - phpMyAdmin: Version 5.2.1 or higher.
# 3. Open your file explorer and follow this path in your file explorer: "C:/Program Files/Ampps/www" unless installation of Ampps is located elsewhere.
# 4. Paste the unzipped folder inside the 'www' directory.
# 5. Open your browser and type "localhost/phpmyadmin/" in your upper search bar
# 6. Login using 'root' as username and 'mysql' as password. Password could also be 'admin'. (These are the default login credentials to your localhost server unless credentials have been manually changed before on your device. Contact your local server administrator for more information, I suppose)
# 7. Navigate to the 'import' tab and drop the characters.sql file found in resources directory of the unzipped directory there.
# 8. Type in your upper search bar: 'localhost/' and from there select the folder you dragged into the www directory.
