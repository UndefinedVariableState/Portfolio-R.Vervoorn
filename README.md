# This is my portfolio with mostly minor projects that I have worked on during my study. Every directory in this repository is a different project. 
# Every directory contains a README.md explaining what the project represents and how to setup the project. Physical demonstrations can always be provided during any potentional interviews.
# the README.md files can viewed by clicking on any of the directories on this GitHub repository or by downloading the corresponding release found in this GitHub repository and viewing it in any code editor.
# Other major projects cannot be viewed here as they don't have a setup guide available and will only be physically demonstrated (obviously due to their complicated setup process)
# All major projects can be viewed as a description on LinkedIn under the "Projects" category on my LinkedIn page and the code is public in seperate repositories.
